<h2>The BLING AVIATON CLUB(BAC), has some exclusive benefits that help our students progress smoothly through their chosen courses. Flight training from an international airport is the obvious one, for multi crew coordination IFR training in particular, but a wide range of experience is also gained from operating out of 500m runways as is the case at our exclusive satellite airfield which is just five minutes away.It adds a third base to the mix and provides quick access to mountain flying terrain.</h2>
